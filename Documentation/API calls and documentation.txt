Goals:
######
To provide the end user with a means of discovering noew books in a variety of genres
in an easy to use visualization.

API'S In Order Considered:
- Freebase
- GoodReads
- Google Books

Reasons for choice of API:
##########################
We ended up going with the google api last minute.  This was because the freebase was 
user driven and lacked the abilitY for us to take interesting information like ratings
and reviewes.

Good reads had similiar information and quite possible a larger number of options but 
would only allow us to run any one api call once persecond limiting the sacalability
of the application.
